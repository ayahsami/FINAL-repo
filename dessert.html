          <p>Om Ali is a traditional dessert in Egypt.

The chosen recipe was later distributed throughout the country, made a national dessert and is now commonly eaten during Ramadan at iftar. <br> Pastry bread is divided into pieces and blended with pistachios, coconut flakes, raisins and plenty of sugar. Milk is poured over the mixture, which is then sprinkled with cinnamon. Finally, the mixture is baked in the oven until the surface is golden brown.</p>
